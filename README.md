# MATLAB Solubility Models
MEng research project: used to compare the performance of different co-solvency solubility models. 
These models can be used to predict the solubility of co-solvent systems.

The current models that are supported are:

p : predictive, e : empirical)
- Log-Linear (e)
- Predictive Log-Linear (p)
- Jouyban-Acree (e)
- General Single Model / GSM (e)
- NRTL (e)
- UNIQUAC (e)

# Documentation

## Folders
The folder directory separates out solubility data from MATLAB files, and then the MATLAB scripts are then further grouped in sub-folders based on their purpose.

- data_files : stores solubility data
- program_files : scripts found here
  - _ModelScript.m_
  - _SolModelTool.mlapp_
  - _corr_funs_ : correlation functions for models
  - _pred_funs_ : predicting functions for models
  - _other_funs_: functions that do other jobs
